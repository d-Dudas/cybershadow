# Faces Behind the Curtain

## Images

### Set 1

- [p1.jpg](./images/set1/p1.jpg)
  - the edges and the hair seems to be detailed, I can't find irregularities
  - from `exiftool` it seems like the timestamp matches the expected time based on the lights
  - I can't find any inconsitencies in lighting or pixel structure
  - I would say this image is **authentic**

- [p2.jpg](./images/set1/p2.jpg)
  - it's really hard to find any inconsistencies or irregularities in hair, edges, lighting or pixel structure
  - even if there are some parts in grass, in the tree leaves and the cow's front legs that I'm not sure about, I can't tell if these are the results of manipulation or not
  - from the `exiftool` results it seems like the timestamp is around 9:14 (same as for p1.jpg and p3.jpg) - however, based on the shadows, the time must be somewhere around 13:00
  - based on some suspicious pixel structure in grass, the tree's leaves and the cow's front legs and on the misleading timestamp, I would say that this image was **manipulated**

- [p3.jpeg](./images/set1/p3.jpg)
  - here is clearly visible that the edges and the hair details have significantly worse quality
  - all around the cow there is a blur-ish aura that removes the end of the hair mostly around from the ear
  - this image was **manipulated**

### Set 2

- [p1.jpg](./images/set2/p1.jpg)
  - everything seems ok with this image
  - I think it's **authentic**
- [p2.jpg](./images/set2/p2.jpg)
  - the hair makes it obvious that the background was changed 
  - around the hair it is really blurry and the end of the hair is missing in some parts, or an extra part of hair was added to the woman on the left
  - this image was **manipulated**
- [p3.jpg](./images/set2/p3.jpg)
  - the "AI generated content" in the left bottom corner of the image might be a clue
  - the girl's hair seems very well edited, I couldn't tell that this image was manipulated based on her hair - however, the woman's hair lose a lot of details in the top, it get's blurred and the end of the hair is very low quality
  - it seems like the man's cap is also different from the previous images, but it would be hard to tell this based only on pixel structure and edges
  - this image was **manipulated**
- [p4.jpg](./images/set2/p4.jpg)
  - almost the same as p3.jpg
  - the girl's hair is edited pretty good again
  - we do not have the "AI generated content" warning
  - the woman's hair is blurred on the top, near and around the edges
  - same observations as for p3.jpg regarding the man's hat 

### Set 3

- [p1.jpg](./images/set3/p1.jpg)
  - I can't find any irregularities with this image
  - I think it's **authentic**
- [p2.jpg](./images/set3/p2.jpg)
  - I can't find any irregularities with this image
  - I think it's **authentic**
- [p3.jpg](./images/set3/p3.jpg)
  - compared to p2.jpg it seems that the girl's teeth are more white, but without having p2.jpg, I couldn't tell that it was manipulated
  - it is obvious that the man was added there artificially
    - the shadow it's on the left side of the women's face, but it's on the right side for the man
    - the line between the man and woman is blury and unnatural
    - the man has contour in some places

### Set 4

- [p1.jpg](./images/set4/p1.jpg)
  - there are multiple blur-ish zones in this image and the cars from the left bottom corner seems to be distorsioned and blurred
  - another blur-ish zone around the left tower
  - another blur-ish zone at the front wheel of the grey car from right
  - this image was **manipulated**
- [p2.jpg](./images/set4/p2.jpg)
  - I can't find any irregularities with this image
  - I think it's **authentic**
